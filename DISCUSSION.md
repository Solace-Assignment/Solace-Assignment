## Dependency Issues

The NPM audit report (attached below) suggests updating `drizzle-kit` to v0.31.1. I would look to collaboratively evaluate this update, given that it is a breaking change.

```zsh
esbuild  <=0.24.2
Severity: moderate
esbuild enables any website to send any requests to the development server and read the response - https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
fix available via `npm audit fix --force`
Will install drizzle-kit@0.31.1, which is a breaking change

## Potential Improvements

- UX/UI: Loading states, pagination, advanced filtering, mobile optimization, accessibility
- Performance: Virtualization, caching, query optimization, memoization
- Code Quality: Test suite, state management, type safety, documentation
- Infrastructure: API versioning, monitoring, security, error tracking
